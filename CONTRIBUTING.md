## Coding conventions

Generally speaking, just try to match the conventions you see in the code you are reading. For this project, these include:

* Do not use shortened command and function names - e.g., `s` instead of `set`, `$p` instead of `$piece`
* One command per line
* Do not use dot syntax
* Indentation with tabs
* Pascal case class and method names
* Avoid using postconditionals
* Local variables start with `t`; formal parameter names start with `p`
* Always check %Status return values

Thanks,
Tim Leavitt, InterSystems Corporation
